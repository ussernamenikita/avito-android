Problem # We have a lot of modules in the project, and things build in parallel very well. However, there is a contention between Android lint and UI-tests in CI builds. Both tasks are on a final application module.
We use workers to parallelize different UI-testing tasks and enable Gradle workers API for available Android Gradle plugin tasks.</description></item><item><title>Open source for CI/CD and test infrastructure for Android</title><link>https://avito-tech.github.io/avito-android/posts/open-source-introduction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avito-tech.github.io/avito-android/posts/open-source-introduction/</guid><description>Open source: CI/CD and test infrastructure for Android # Avito.ru is the second biggest classified in the world. We have moved our Android infrastructure into open source: Gradle plugins, emulators, and test libraries. Our code will be useful in automating CI/CD and will also facilitate the coding and support of autotests.
In this review, we will explain why we decided to move into open source, present the central libraries of the project, and suggest whom to contact with any questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
