We have moved our Android infrastructure into open source: Gradle plugins, emulators, and test libraries. Our code will be useful in automating CI/CD and will also facilitate the coding and support of autotests.
In this review, we will explain why we decided to move into open source, present the central libraries of the project, and suggest whom to contact with any questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
